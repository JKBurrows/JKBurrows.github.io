title: Intro to R

### What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used? 

In addition to R, I have used SAS and Python. R is very different from SAS. Writing and using functions is one of the main focuses of R. This is not the case with SAS. Also, R is built on open source software, whereas SAS is proprietary. On the other hand, R and Python are not so different. I think that everything that I have done so far in R could be translated into Python code that looks more or less the same. 

### What functionality do you like about R?  

I like that lots of open source packages are available, and I think that R Studio is pretty intuitive. Also, I like that R’s help() function offers quick access to documentation. 

### What parts do you miss about your other language?  

I miss SAS’s format procedure, which is very helpful for displaying data. I also liked that, when SAS throws an error or warning, it does a good job of pointing to the exact spot that caused the problem, and it does a good job of explaining what is causing the problem. So far, I have found R’s error and warning messages more difficult to understand. 

### Do you consider R a difficult language to learn?

I do not think that it has been any more or less difficult than SAS or Python. The commands are reasonably intuitively, and the concepts, such as using one function after another to produce a result, are not too difficult to understand. We’ll see if I change my mind, though, when I try to do more complicated things.
