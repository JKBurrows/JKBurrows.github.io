title: Data Science and Statistics
---

What do you think being a data scientist is about?  
	The job of a data scientist is to extract useful information from data. Doing this job requires familiarity with computer programming as well as knowledge of mathematical statistics. Furthermore, it requires ‘domain specific knowledge’, that is, an understanding of the industry in which the data scientist is working. 
	
What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  
	The duties of a data scientist include reading and cleaning raw data, exploring and summarizing data, model fitting, and presenting conclusions in a digestible format. To perform these duties, a data scientist needs to be familiar with statistical computing languages such as R, SAS, and Python as well as statistical tools such as hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, regression analysis, and so on. 

What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  
	Earlier I said that the job of a data scientist is to extract useful information from data. The same could be said of a statistician. As a result, the skill bases of the two typically overlap. Data scientists typically know some statistics, and statisticians typically know some computer programming. 
Although the two specializations are similar, they are not the same. One difference is that data scientists typically work with data sets that are large and/or frequently updated. This requires a facility with computer programming. Another difference is that statisticians are more likely to be involved in the design of an experiment or survey. This is because the tools of mathematical statistics are required in order to know what we will be able to infer from the results of an experiment or survey once it is performed. 

How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?
	I’m still a student, so right now my relation to these two areas is ‘I read job descriptions that mention them sometimes’. Eventually, I hope to become familiar with both areas. The name of my master’s program is ‘Statistics’, though, not ‘Data Science’, so I will probably end up becoming more familiar with statistics.
