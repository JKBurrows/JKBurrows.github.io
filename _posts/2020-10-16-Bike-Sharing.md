### Topic and Finding 

[This](https://jkburrows.github.io/ST558-Project-2/) is a link to my bike sharing project. [This](https://github.com/JKBurrows/ST558-Project-2) is a link to the github repo. 

My goal was to predict number of bikes rented. I created two models to make this prediction, a basic non-ensemble tree model and a boosted tree model. Unsurprisingly, the boosted tree did better than the basic non-ensemble model when tested. 

### What would you do differently? 

If I did this project again, I would work on automating descriptions of the contents of the plots. The rubric did not require us to do this, but I can think of ways to do it, and if I had more time I would like to try them out. 

Another thing that I would do differently is figure out how to change the color of text. I would have liked to do this in a couple of places, but according to the internet, it can’t be done with markdown syntax. Which means that I would have to resort to HTML. I’d have to do some reading to figure out how to make that work. 

### What was the most difficult part for you? 

The most difficult part was getting the automation up and running. Now that I have it figured out, it works just fine, but it was frustrating in the beginning. The biggest issue was that it took me a while to figure out that a default parameter has to be included in the YAML header. 

### What are your big take-aways from this project? 

One big take away is that the `caret` package really does make modeling easy. All that you need to do is specify a few parameters and then wait a few minutes for it to run. This means that you could create a lot of different models without knowing much about how they work. I expect, though, that in practice modeling blindly leads to problems.  

A small take away is that it is important to clear your cache before finalizing your work. I knew this, but I’d never done a project where it came into play before.
