### What (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do?

In my first blog post, I wrote that that job of a data scientist is to extract useful information from data, which requires knowledge of computer programming and statistics as well as domain specific knowledge. Taking this class hasn’t changed my mind. If anything, it has confirmed this understanding of data science. Programming is obviously important, and the class stressed the importance of domain specific knowledge for things like candidate model selection. Although traditional statistical methods such as inference were not emphasized, understanding many different types of models was, and the connections to time series and Bayesian statistics are clear.  

### What are your current thoughts in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?

I think that R is straightforward once you know how to use it. Also, I’m impressed by the wide variety of packages that are available. Often there is more than one package for a given subject, so there is usually more than one way to complete a task. In addition to packages, there are lots of helpful blog posts and many free textbooks available online. These make it easier to learn new data science subjects. 

I think that, if I do a data science project in my spare time, I will use R. If I get a job in the field, though, who knows what language they will want me to use. 

### What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?

One thing that I will do differently in practice is think about how a problem can be solved in both SAS and R. Now that I know both, it is natural to think in both languages and compare the two. Another thing that I will do differently is use RStudio. I like RStudio a lot, and it looks easy enough to use it for coding in other languages.
